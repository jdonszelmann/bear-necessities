The 🐻 necessities started as a collection of documentation on tools and techniques we &mdash; Vivian and Jonathan &mdash; learned over the years and found essential in our day-to-day life. Both simple things we couldn't go without, and complex things we don't want to forget. This website serves as a knowledge base and tutorial for ourselves, and you!
